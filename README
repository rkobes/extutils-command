ExtUtils::Command provides a number of utilities to replace 
common UNIX commands in Makefiles, etc. At present the list includes
cp, rm_f, rm_rf, mv, cat, eqtime, mkpath, touch, test_f, test_d,
chmod, and dos2unix. Also included is the companion module
Shell::Command, which is a thin wrapper for ExtUtils::Command
to provide cross-platform functions emulating common shell commands.

To install, execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   $MAKE
   $MAKE test
   $MAKE install

where $MAKE is the make program appropriate for your system.
Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed, you can do

  perl Build.PL
  perl Build
  perl Build test
  perl Build install
